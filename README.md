      9. install was clicked to begin installation and finished was clicked to verify installation
     10. git bash was opend and the command 'git --version' was run to confirm that installation was done correctly
     11. github.com was accessed using the system browere
     12. an account was created
     13. selected creat a new repository
     14. repository address was  copied and pasted on git bash using the 'git clone' command



4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

  procedure:
   1. http://wwww.python.org was accessed using the system brower
   2. the latest version for python installer package was downloaded
   3. the installer was runned and python was downloaded
   4. the location of the installed python was updated in the path for enviroment viriables

    5. execute was clicked to begin installation
    6. a new root password for mysql was set
    7. installation was completed with no issues


7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
